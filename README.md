### Work In Progress
## Simple Task Management with ELO

## Introduction
In this project I have used two algorithm, 
* Greedy Job Sequencing Algorithm with deadline and profit.
  * This used for finding which task should be carried base on their profit and deadline.
* ELO Rating Algorithm 
  * This algorithm is used to rating the task based on their deadline, sprint time winning status.

## Greedy Job Sequencing with deadline and profit
Job Sequencing Problem with Deadline consists of jobs each associated with a deadline and profit and our objective is to earn maximum profit. We can earn profit only when a job is completed on or before the deadline.[
## ELO
Elo Rating Algorithm is widely used rating algorithm that is used to rank players in many competitive games.
Players with higher ELO rating have a higher probability of winning a game than a player with lower ELO rating. After each game, ELO rating of players is updated. If a player with higher ELO rating wins, only a few points are transferred from the lower rated player. However if lower rated player wins, then transferred points from a higher rated player are far greater.
Manual Implementation of Elo algorithm 
In this project we have used pairwise approach

## Future Work
* Update the alogrithm with different approach likes
  * The Proportional Rating Approach
  * The Modified Expected Score Approach
* More natural view
* User's Interaction Pages
